# Hero Hub

## Description
Welcome to Hero Hub! 

We built Hero Hub so that superhero fans can test their knowledge of their favorite characters through quizzes. The site allows users that register to create their own quizzes as well as use the chat feature to communicate with other players on the site. If a member of the site scores high enough, their score and username will be added to the leaderboard which displays the top 10 users and scores for that quiz. Before taking the quiz, the user can select a difficulty which will increase the speed in which they have to take the quiz. 

Best of luck getting the next high score!
